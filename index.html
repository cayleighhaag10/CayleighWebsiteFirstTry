<p style="color:rgb(173,216,230);font-family:verdana;">This is my second body paragraph.</p>

<pre>
   Let us try this

	with spacing.</pre>

<p> Now let's test some different types of text formatting. <b>This text is bold. </b> <strong>This text is strong. </strong><I>This text is italicized. </I> <em>This text is empathized. </em> <small>This text is small. </small> There is a <mark>portion</mark> of this text that is highlighted and a <del>portion</del> that has been deleted. This line includes <ins> some text that has been inserted or underlined</ins>. Finally this is a <sub>subscript</sub> and this is a <sup>superscript</sup>. </p>

<p> If you choose to include a quote, <q>GOOSE</q> it is best to do this. You can cite your source as follows: <cite>Finley</cite>. </p>

<p id="Colors">Let us now look at some colors!</p>
<p style="color:rgb(255, 165, 0);">This is done using <b>RGB</b>.</p>
<p style="color:rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.7);">This has alpha = 0.7, so it is not fully opaque.</p>
<p style="color:#3cb371;">This is done using a <I>hex</I>!</p>
<p style="color:hsl(244, 51%, 77%);">We can also use hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is 0 to 360 and the remaining 2 inputs are percentages (with percent signs).</p>
<p style="color:hsla(244, 51%, 77%, 0.7);">This is also HSL but with an alpha component of 0.7.</p>
